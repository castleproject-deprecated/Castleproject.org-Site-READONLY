	<section>
		<title>Is constructor or property "injection" supported?</title>

		<p>
		Yes, it has always been supported.
		</p>

	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Is an "injection" approach recommended more strongly?</title>

		<p>
		No, but from the MicroKernel point of view there's a semantic
		on constructors and another one for properties. Constructor parameters
		are treated as non-optional dependencies while properties are considered
		optional.
		</p>

	<section>
		<title>My interface/class has generic arguments or generic methods. Is it supported?</title>

		<p>
		Yes, but you cannot associate an interceptor with these classes. 
		Dynamic Proxy 1.1.5 does not support generic interfaces or classes.
		This is going to be fixed on the next release. Promise.

	<section>
		<title>I registered a class that implements a service 
		but I cannot set its properties</title>

		<p>
		This happens if you have an interceptor associated with the class as
		the proxy generated by DynamicProxy 1.1.5 does not allow the container
		to access the target.
		This is going to be fixed on the next release. Promise.
