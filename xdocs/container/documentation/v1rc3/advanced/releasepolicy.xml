<intro>

<p>
The best usage of the container is one that requests 
the component, uses it and then calls <tt>ReleaseComponent</tt> so 
the container can invoke all decommission phases and do 
the proper clean up. We know that sometimes this is 
too much to ask, so the MicroKernel has a pluggable 
release policy that can hook up and implement some 
routing to dispose the components.
</p>

<p>
The MicroKernel comes with three <tt>IReleasePolicy</tt> implementations:

<ul>
<li><tt>AllComponentsReleasePolicy</tt>: track all components to enforce correct disposal upon the MicroKernel instance disposal</li>
<li><tt>LifecycledComponentsReleasePolicy</tt>: only track components that have a decommission lifecycle associated</li>
<li><tt>NoTrackingReleasePolicy</tt>: does not perform any tracking </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can also implement your own release policy by using the interface <tt>IReleasePolicy</tt>.
