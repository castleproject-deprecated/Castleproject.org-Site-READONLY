<p>
Each <tt>ComponentModel</tt> holds a <tt>LifecycleStepCollection</tt> where steps to be invoked 
can be registered. There are two possible phases for step executions: commission, 
which is when the component is created, and decomission which is when the component
is about to be discarded by the MicroKernel.
</p>

<p>
You can register your own steps to be executed using the collection mentioned above.
