<intro>

<p>
A facility is a unit of extension that can be registered into the Castle MicroKernel.
It may augment the container functionality in different ways: it can introduce 
new semantics or integrate the MicroKernel with 
some external tool or framework. We currently have a set of facilities 
that you can use and especially see their implementation to learn more.
</p>

<p>
For example, the Startable facility allow components to have a startable semantic,
which means they can be started and stopped. It also takes care of starting them.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand the NHibernate Facility configures NHibernate, handles transactions
and exposes NHibernate's ISessionFactory as services so your components can access 
it.
