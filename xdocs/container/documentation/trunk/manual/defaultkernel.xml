<intro>

<p>
The <tt>DefaultKernel</tt> implements the <tt>IKernel</tt>
interface and hence exposes the default kernel functionality.
The implementation does go beyond delegation and small validations.
</p>

<p>
The most important methods are the <tt>AddComponent</tt> overloads and variations, and
the indexer used to obtain component instances. Component instances can be lookup
by Type or by the key used to register them. Bear in mind that more
than one component that implements the same service can be registered.
In the case, if a component is looked up by the service type, the first one registered
is returned.
