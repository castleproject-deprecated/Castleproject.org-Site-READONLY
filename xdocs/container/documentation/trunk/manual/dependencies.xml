<intro>

<p>
There are three types of dependencies that the MicroKernel is able to 
handle:
</p>

<p>
<ul> 
<li> Service: a dependency on a service, usually represented by an interface. </li>
<li> ServiceOverride: a dependency that was overridden by the programmer, 
  which instructs the MicroKernel to use another component</li>
<li> Parameter: a dependency on a value which is not another component instance. For example, an int or an string. </li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
The dependencies are resolved by a single entity, the <tt>DefaultDependencyResolver</tt>
which implements the <tt>IDependencyResolver</tt> interface.
The implementation checks the dependency type and based on that look up the container
or the configuration in order to resolve it.
</p>

<p>
One can register its own dependency resolver within the <tt>DefaultDependencyResolver</tt>.
All that is need is an <tt>ISubDependencyResolver</tt> implementation which has priority 
whenever a dependency is being resolved. This allow customization of the dependency resolution
process.
