<intro>

<p>
The <tt>WindsorContainer</tt> implements the <tt>IWindsorContainer</tt>
interface. The implementation is mostly in charge of resolving the
configuration location, loading it and registering the facilities 
and components on the configuration.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>IKernel</tt> is exposed by the <tt>Kernel</tt> property. 
As in the <tt>IKernel</tt>, the most important methods are 
<tt>AddComponent</tt> and <tt>Resolve</tt> overloads. If you are
using .net 2 you will find overloads that make use of generic
arguments to avoid unnecessary type casts.
