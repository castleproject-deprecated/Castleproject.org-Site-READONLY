<intro>

<p>
You don't have to keep all configuration in a single file. 
Includes allow you to refer to configuration in other places.
</p>

<p>
All you need to do is specify an include node with the Uri 
that will be used to create the proper Resource. For example, 
the following will use the FileResource:
</p>

<pre format="html"><![CDATA[
    <include uri="file://c:\mydir\services.xml">
]]></pre>
	
<p>
	The file is relative to the configuration file that has
	the include:
</p>
	
<pre format="html"><![CDATA[
	<include uri="file://Configurations/facilities.xml">
	<include uri="file://Configurations/services.xml">
]]></pre>

<p>
	The next one uses an assembly resource:
</p>

<pre format="html"><![CDATA[
    <include uri="assembly://Castle.Windsor.Tests/Configuration2/include1.xml"> 
]]></pre>

<p>
	The next one will use an section inside the configuration associated 
	with the container. 
</p>

<pre format="html"><![CDATA[
	<include uri="config://castle"> ]]></pre>

	<p>
	Note that you must include the section declaration, like the following:
	</p>

<pre format="html"><![CDATA[
<configSections>
	<section 
		name="castle"
		type="Castle.Windsor.Configuration.AppDomain.CastleSectionHandler, Castle.Windsor" />
</configSections>]]></pre>

<p>
The next one will use a file in a network share
</p>

<pre format="html"><![CDATA[
    <include uri="\\mysharedplace\myconfig.xml"> ]]></pre>

<p>
You can use multiple includes. Just have in mind that an id cannot repeat. 
If it does, the last registered id for the facility or for the component 
will be used and the previous will be discarded without warning or exceptions 
being thrown.
