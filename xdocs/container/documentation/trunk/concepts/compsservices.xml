A component is a small unit of reusable code. It should implement and 
expose just one service, and do it well. In practical terms, a component 
is a class that implements an interface (service). The interface is the 
service's contract, which creates an abstraction layer so you can 
replace the service implementation without effort.

We may use the terms component and service interchangeably on the documents.
