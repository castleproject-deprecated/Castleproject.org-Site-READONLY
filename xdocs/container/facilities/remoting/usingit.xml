<intro>

<p>
The facility works on both server and client side, 
and you can even have a situation where the application serves as both endpoints.
</p>

<p>
The remoting configuration (channels, formatters) is 
external and it is the same file that is accepted by .net 
remoting. Please 
check its <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/gnconRemotingSettingsSchema.asp">official documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
For each component that is remote (client or server) you must supply the remoting strategy. We currently support:

<ul>
<li> <tt>Singleton</tt>: which maps to a wellknown service in mode singleton </li>
<li> <tt>SingleCall</tt>: which maps to a wellknown service in mode singlecall</li>
<li> <tt>ClientActivated</tt>: which maps to a client activated service (one server instance per client request)</li>
<li> <tt>Component</tt>: activation goes through the communication between the client container and the server container</li>
<li> <tt>RecoverableComponent</tt>: activation goes through the communication between the client container 
and the server container, but the server can be restarted without any problem. The component must be use the <tt>Singleton</tt> lifestyle. </li>
</ul>

The following depicts the full configuration scheme for the facility. 
Most of the attributes are optional or only required for some specific 
scenarios. The scenarios will be discussed further in this document.
</p>

<pre format="html"><![CDATA[
<facility 
  id="remote.facility" 
  isServer="true|false"
  isClient="true|false"
  kernelUri="a valid identifier"
  remoteKernelUri="a full uri including protocol, host, path and resource"
  remotingConfigurationFile="absolute or relative path to the remoting configuration file" />
]]></pre>

<p>
The following depicts the attributes which are available on the component nodes:
</p>

<pre format="html"><![CDATA[
<component 
  id="" 
  remoteclient="singleton|singlecall|clientactivated|component|recoverableComponent " 
  uri="required for singleton, singlecall and recoverableComponent but if not present, the component id is used" />
]]></pre>

	<title>Supported Scenarios</title>

	<p>
	There are varios situations where the Remoting Facility can become handy. 
	The following sections exemplifies each one and presents any caveat that they might have.
	
	<ul>
	<li><a href="oneendpoint.html">Using the container on just one endpoint</a></li>
	<li><a href="bothendpoints.html">Using the container on both endpoints but just to configure remoting</a></li>
	<li><a href="containersconnected.html">Using the container on both endpoints and use the container components</a></li>
	</ul>
