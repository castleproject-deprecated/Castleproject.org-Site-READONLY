<intro>
<p>
This page is a test of the NVelocity transformation for the castle website. There are
examples of all the "standard" things that need to work, along with some other edge
cases that may work now. Wouldn't that be nice? I mean, like cupcake with sprinkles
brought to work! That would be nice. Or, Pizza Hut, right Hammet?!? Gotta love the hut!
</p>

<p>
Here comes an unordered list. No biggie:
<ul>
<li>The first list item</li>
<li>The second list item, how come I always have to be second?</li>
<li> Shut up, at least you aren't third!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Oh ho ho, look who is whining, number two and number three. That is rich. I
am just a simple standalone paragraph. People shove all kinds of things in here
and sometimes ... I am left empty ... AS A SPACER! Arrgghgh.
</p>

<p>
But this time, I am being used to tell you, the reader, that the next thing you will see
is a download section. -->
</p>
<download relative="!download/activerecord/InitializingAndConfiguring.zip" filename="InitializingAndConfiguring.zip">

</download>
<p>
Did you see it? What? It is right there ... look up ... there you go. What if you
want one of those in a list? Or maybe more of them ... Let's try it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<download relative="!download/activerecord/InitializingAndConfiguring.zip" filename="InitializingAndConfiguring.zip">

</download>
</li>
<li>
<download relative="!download/activerecord/InitializingAndConfiguring.zip" filename="InitializingAndConfiguring.zip">

</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nice right? I thought so. Oh, and did I mention that all this was just the Intro? 
Now on to the sections.
</p>
</intro>

<section id="TheBigCheese">
	<title>The Big Cheese (or, Section 1)</title>
	
	<p>
	I am The Big Cheese, The Head  Honcho, King of all the sections and as
	such my title should be at the top of the Table of Contents and my heading 
	should be using an H1 tag. Meaning, it should be the biggest - unless some
	joker has been messing with my style sheet. Yeah, real funny, make my heading
	8pt. Oh, if only I was sentient, corporeal and had legs and arms .. I would
	storm right out of this body tag and wring your neck...
	I..uh...sorry. Got a little distracted. Anyway, you should see the other sections 
	below me in the TOC.
	</p>
	
	<section>
		<title>Number Two</title>
		<p>
		I used to be called number 1 but most people don't realize that counting
		really starts at ZERO. Here I am. Number Two. Man, Number One was sooooo
		much cooler. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Well, while we are here why don't we try to embed some C# code into the section...
		</p>
			
<pre format="cs">
using Demote.Section
ISection section = page.Section1;
section.Name = "Section Two";
</pre>
		
		<note>
		<p>
		Ha ha ha, real funny wise guy. Thanks for rubbing it in, and in psuedo code too.	
		</p>
		</note>
	
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Another Sub Section</title>
	
		<p>
		I know, Section Two doesn't like being number two but he doesn't even know
		what it is like ... I mean, I am section 3 and I am just glad to be here. Most
		lazy programmers won't get past two. <br/><br/> Oh I know! We can try out some fancy stuff here
		- I mean, I never really get to do this kind of stuff...
		</p>
		
		<p>
		How about some C# code <b>inside</b> this paragraph? <br/>
<pre format="cs">
using Demote.Section
ISection section = page.Section1;
section.Name = "Section Two";
</pre>
		
		<warning>
		<p>
		Hey! I am still here you know! -- Section Two
		</p>
		</warning>
	
		Sorry, I just had to do it. 
		<br/><br/>Heh. What's he going to do? He's static HTML.<br/><br/>
		Oh, by the way, that warning was also in the paragraph! Cool!
		</p>

<section id="MajorSection">
	<title>Major Section</title>

	<p>
	Major Section reporting for duty. Section One, bah. Everyone knows you don't
	start to get into the cool stuff until the second section. Have fun with that
	introduction and review ... ha ha ha ... loser. We have discipline in my section! 
	Discipline is the order of the day. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Let's just get right to it, shall we? Sound off
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>List Item One, sir</li>
	<li>List Item Two, sir</li>
	<li>List Item Three, sir</li>
	<li>zzzzzzzzz 
	<warning>
	<p> Are you sleeping in my section boy?!?!?</p>
	</warning>
	Uh, no sir. I mean, yes sir.
	<warning>
	<p>Well sound off soldier!</p>
	</warning>
	List Item Four, sir	</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
	The little wastes of white space are an Ordered List Company 1. Sorry about the
	warnings right in there, but I had to show that list items that I will put the
	hammer down when, and where I want.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For example; List Item 1!
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Sir!</li>
	</ol>
	Repeat the List Item Code of Conduct! Starting with the XHTML oath!
	<ol>
	<li>Sir, yes sir!
	
	<p>
	The XHTML Oath is:<br/>
	The Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) is a family of current
    and future document types and modules that reproduce, subset, ... and, uh, and ...
	</p>
	<warning>
	<p>
	What's that boy? I can't hear you!!
	</p>
	</warning>
	<p>
	and extend HTML, reformulated in XML. XHTML Family document types
    are all XML-based, and ultimately are designed to work in conjunction with
    XML-based user agents. XHTML is the successor of HTML, and a series of specifications has been developed for
    XHTML.
	</p>
	<note>
	<p>
	Very good ... now the List Item Code!
	</p>
	</note>
	<p>
	Ordered and unordered lists are rendered in an identical manner except that 
	visual user agents number ordered list items. User agents may present those 
	numbers in a variety of ways. Unordered list items are not numbered.
	Both types of lists are made up of sequences of list items defined by the 
	LI element (whose end tag may be omitted).
	</p>
	<note>
	<p>
	Let' show them how we are able to nest!
	</p>
	</note>
	<p>
	Sir, yes sir!
	</p>
	Sound off list!
		<ol>
			<li>List Item 1</li>
			<li>List Item 2</li>
			<li>List Item 3</li>
			<li>List Item 4</li>
