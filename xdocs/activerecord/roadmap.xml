<intro>
<p>
We present below our plans of what will add, changed (and eventually removed) on
upcoming version of Castle ActiveRecord.

<ul>

	<li>
	Upgrade to NHibernate 1.2
	</li>

	<li>
	Enhance generic support
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Composite Keys: make it support relations on the Key class,
	and relations that use classes with composite keys should infer the
	columns that compose the key.
	</li>

	<li>
	Allow relations to use different columns (than the usual PK)
	</li>

</ul>
