		<title>What is ActiveRecord?</title>

	<p>
	ActiveRecord is a well-known pattern described in 
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321127420/qid=1119217017/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-5320883-5187853">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>. 
	Basically all static methods act on the whole set of records, while instances represents each row.

		<title>What is Castle ActiveRecord?</title>

	<p>
	Castle ActiveRecord is an implementation of the ActiveRecord Pattern inspired by <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/?u=ar.rubyonrails.com">Rails' ActiveRecord</a>, which relies on NHibernate to perform the actual mapping (as you see we don't suffer from Not-invented-here anti-pattern).
	</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>How does it differ from pure NHibernate usage?</title>

	<p>
	Castle ActiveRecord was built on top of NHibernate. It offers:
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
<li>Fast development (it handles the mapping and infers as much as it can so you dont have to dig into documentation or deal with tons of xmls everytime something changes on your schema)</li>
<li>Predefined common methods like <tt>Create</tt>, <tt>Update</tt>, <tt>Save</tt>, <tt>Delete</tt></li>
<li>Easy to implement method like <tt>Find</tt>, <tt>FindAll</tt>, <tt>FindByName</tt>. </li>
<li>Session and transaction scopes that abstracts the <tt>ISession</tt> and translates them to a more natural idiom</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
By using pure NHibernate, you have more control over more complex mappings. But using ActiveRecord is a guarantee to boost your productivity.

	<section>
		<title>My text columns are being truncated</title>
	
	<p>
	Add <tt>ColumnType="StringClob"</tt> parameter to your <tt>Property</tt> attribute. For example:
	</p>

<pre format="cs">
[Property(ColumnType="StringClob")]
public String Contents
{
	get { return _contents; }
	set { _contents = value; }
}
</pre>

<p>
This tells NHibernate to map the string to a Text type rather than a nvarchar(4000) type.

	<section>
	<title>
	ActiveRecord throws an exception saying: Ambiguous column name 'Status'
	</title>
	
	<p>
	A column named <tt>Status</tt> is returned internally by 
	NHibernate. Try renaming your column in the database.

		<title>Changes to objects are persisted without an explicit call to the Save() method</title>
		
		<p>
	This commonly happens if you are using SessionScope per request pattern. 
	Basically this is expected NHibernate 
	behaviour although the first time you experience it,
	it can seem very confusing.

From: <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/359.html#A7">NHibernate Users FAQ</a>
		</p>

		<p><i>
"When an object is loaded by NHibernate the ISession keeps a snapshot of the state of your object. When you Flush() the ISession NHibernate compares that snapshot to the current state of the object. The appropriate changes are written to the database."
		</i></p>

		<p>
So when the Session is Flush()ed any changes to an objects state are written to the database. The next question is when does a Flush() occur? Well according to <a href="http://www.tobinharris.com/nhibernatefaq.aspx">Tobins' NHibernate FAQ</a>
 it can occur at a number of different (and possibly unexpected) places. 
		</p>

		<p>
		If this is really bothering you, you can create a readonly 
		<tt>SessionScope</tt>. 
		In this case it is up to you to Flush it. You can read more about 
		the SessionScope on ActiveRecord documentation.
