<p>
Sometimes you have a field that is a look-up against a static 
group of ID/types that are either short enough to not be 
worth a whole separate table, or for organizational reasons 
don't make sense as a BelongsTo.  
For example, an article, page on a web-site, or blog post 
could have a statusID that indicates its stage in workflow.  
To work with something familiar let's modify Post from the 

<a href="https://svn.castleproject.org/svn/castle/trunk/Samples/ActiveRecord/BlogSample">BlogSample</a> to have multiple states.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the class is left out for brevity, check the sample if you like.
</p>

<pre format="cs">
using Castle.ActiveRecord;

[ActiveRecord]
public class Post : ActiveRecordBase
{
   private StatusType _status_type_id;
   
   public enum StatusType
   {
      Editing = 0,
      Published = 1,
      Archived = 2
   }
   
   [Property("status_type_id")]
   public StatusType Status
   {
      get { return _status_type_id; }
      set { _status_type_id = value; }
   }
}
</pre>

<p>
Then you can use <tt>Post.Status</tt>
like any other property, or like any other enum, for example, setting
</p>

<pre format="cs">
Post.Status = Post.StatusType.Archived;
</pre>
