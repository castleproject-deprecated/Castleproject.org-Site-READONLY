	<p>
	Enable lazy load for relations as described on the <a href="../usersguide/lazy.html">
	User's guide: Enabling lazy load</a>. Complex types might deserve 
	lazy enabled as well, but making all types lazy is not necessarily good.

	<title>Relations overused</title>
	
	<p>
	If your code does intensive work on relations, consider replacing the operation by
	a <a href="../usersguide/hql.html">HQL query</a>. Databases are very optimized to 
	handle process on a  huge amount of data.
