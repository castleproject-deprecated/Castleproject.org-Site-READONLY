<p>
From RC2 on, ActiveRecord will not support .net 1.1
</p>

<p>
The validation support was refactored to rely on Castle.Components.Validator.
The changes should be transparent, with the exception of ValidateNotEmpty that should be
renamed to ValidateNonEmpty
</p>

<p>
The method CountAll was renamed to Count
