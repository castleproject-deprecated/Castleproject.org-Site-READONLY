<intro>
<p>
More important than knowing how to map ActiveRecord-Classes is knowing how
to use them. The underlying NHibernate is mostly abstracted by ActiveRecord,
however there are basic concepts about NHibernate persistence knowledge of
is required to use Castle ActiveRecord.
</p>
</intro>

<section id="session">
	<title>Understanding Sessions</title>
	<p>
		NHibernate uses the concept of a session. Castle ActiveRecord abstracts using
		the session by doing the session management for the using code, but the session 
		concept is necessary to grasp the concepts behind object persistence
		with NHibernate and Castle ActiveRecord.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <strong>session</strong> is a unit of work boundary of NHibernate. Objects that
		are <strong>connected</strong> to a session, will be persisted to the database specified
		in the session. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A session will not write to the database everytime something is changed. In order to achieve better performance,
		database access is usually delayed until the last possible moment. This avoids unnecessary
		database calls, i. e. when multiple fields of a persistent objects are changed within a 
		session. This synchronization with the database is called <strong>flushing</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sessions can use <strong>transactions</strong> that offer the ability to create 
		all-or-nothing change sets that span multiple flushes. Such a transaction is distinct from
		a database transaction, although it uses the latter internally. 
	</p>
</section>

<section id="attributes">
	<title>The Attributes of Objects</title>

	<p>
		With respect to object-relational mapping there are different attributes of objects to look at.
		Each of these attributes describes a certain aspect of an object that is important to persistence.
		These attributes will be put together into a lifecycle consisting of several states that are defined
		by combining the attributes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most simply, an object can be <strong>existant</strong> or <strong>non-existant</strong>. Since there
		will be a lot of objects that live only as database records, but not in memory, non-existant is an
		important object state in O/R. Another naming convention differs between <strong>activated</strong> and
		<strong>passivated</strong> objects, but this makes only sense to persistant objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Regarding persistence, an object can be <strong>transient</strong> or <strong>persistant</strong>. A
		persistent object is backed by a database record, a transient object is not.
	</p>
	<p>
		In any session, an object can be <strong>attached</strong> or <strong>detached</strong>. An attached object
		is connected to the session. It will be monitored by that session and saved to the database.  
	</p>
	<p>
		An object can be <strong>unchanged</strong> or <strong>changed</strong>. A changed object's state
		has been altered and is not synchronized to it's database record if it is persistant.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="entitystate">
	<title>Entity States</title>
	<p>
		The states presented here deal with entities. The word <strong>entity</strong> is used here to describe
		the combination of object and database record.
	</p>
	<table class="commontable">
		<tr>
			<th>State</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>

				The entity does not yet exist, neither in memory nor in the database.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center">Transient</td>
			<td>
				The entity has been created and lives in memory. It has no connection to a database
				record because it either wasn't saved to the database before or it has been already deleted.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center">Unsaved</td>
			<td>

				A persistant entity that has no unsaved changes to its state.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center">Changed (Dirty)</td>
			<td>
				A persistant entity that has unsaved changes to the objects internal state.
				The next time, changes are sent (flushed) to the database, the changes will be written
				to the associated database record, synchronizing the objects internal state with the database
				record.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center">Detached</td>
			<td>
					A persistant entity is normally attached to a session. The session tracks changes to the
					entity and takes care for flushing that changes back to the database. If changes should not
					be saved or the object shall leave the scope of its session, it can be detached from the
					session. The entity is still persistant, but the object is temporarily transient. It can be 
					reattached to another session.<br />
					A common examples for detaching and reattaching is keeping an object stored in an ASP.NET session
					store and save changes back when the object is back in a consistant state several pages later.
					This technique is used when creating wizard-like web pages for supporting complex workflows.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center">Deleted</td>
			<td>
				The entity is persistant, but the database record is scheduled for deletion.
				The object may still exist in memory, but it will become transient after the next flush.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center">Stale</td>
			<td>
				When a persistant entity's database record has been changed by another session, changes of
				the objects internal state cannot be synchronized anymore with the database. This entity's
				state is called stale.

<section id="scenarios">
	<title>Common Scenarios</title>
	
	<p>
		This section deals with common scenarios that use ORM to persist changes with different
		requirements. The scenarios show how the different states of entities can be used to
		satisfy the special limitations of the scenario.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout the scenario discussion, the necessary state transitions are explained when
		they first appear. It is therefore advisable to read the scenarios completely, even when
		looking for how to support only one of the application types.
	</p>
	
	<section id="scenario-crud">
		<title>CRUD</title>
		<p>
			This scenario discusses the basic usage of persistant entities. Although there is not
			much business logic involved, almost all applications contain code to <strong>C</strong>reate,
			<strong>R</strong>ead, <strong>U</strong>pdate and <strong>D</strong>elete entities. 
		</p>
		<p>
			CRUD functionality is commonly used for administration purposes, allowing operations to 
			rectify data when an error is discovered in an application that leads to data corruption.
			Other types of applications consist mostly of CRUD screens. Among these, most prominent are
			MS Access databases. If such an application has to be replaced with an ActiveRecord application,
			the biggest part of the application will handle CRUD.
		</p>
		<p>
			At first, an entity must be created. An object of the entity class is instantiated. This object
			is now transient. Its properties and fields will be populated.
		</p>
		<p>
			To store the object in the database, either the method <tt>entity.Save()</tt> or <tt>entity.Create()</tt>
			must be called. This call tells ActiveRecord that the entity should be persisted. It isn't yet, but
			creation is scheduled for the next flush. This state is called unsaved.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the session flushes, all changes are written to the database. This includes creating database rows
			for unsaved objects. After the flush, the entity is persistent and unchanged, since it has been just
			synchronized with the datastore. 
		</p>
		<warning>
			<p>
				Depending on the mapping of the primary key, it is possible that ActiveRecord hits the database
				immediately after calling <tt>Save()</tt> or <tt>Create()</tt>. This is the case if a native
				primary key (for example <tt>IDENTITY</tt> in SQLServer) is used. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This action will insert the record but not perform a full flush and can lead to unexpected results.
				It is therefore recommended not to use native primary keys. Code that is cluttered with explicit calls
				to <tt>scope.Flush()</tt> heavily suffers from native primary keys.
			</p>
			<p>
				More information on mapping primary keys is found in the section about 
				<a href="pks.html">primary key mapping</a>.
			</p>
		</warning>
		<p>
			Now that the entity is created, it must be shown to the user, either with other entities as part of a
			list or aggregation or on its own. If the object is not already present in the session because it has 
			just been	created, it must be loaded from the database. This is the R in CRUD. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Fetching entities from the datastore is accomplished by calling <tt>Entity.Find(key)</tt>. Other methods
			read more than one entity and allow querying for specific objects. All of these methods are static 
			methods of the entity class and start with <tt>Find</tt>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The <tt>Find</tt> method reads the data from the record and creates an object, populating it with the data
			read from the database. This method is persistant and unchanged. The object can now be displayed to the
			user and changed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Supposed that the object has been displayed with widgets that allow updating its properties, the user can
			change the object by editing the data. After the user submits the form in a web application, the data
			is sent back to the server, starting the <strong>U</strong> in CRUD.
		</p>
		<p>
			The server has just started a new session with the new request (this is strongly recommended). It will 
			fetch the entity from the database, and the object is created and unchanged. The server process now
			changes the objects properties according to the data submitted by the user. The objects state will
			change from unchanged to changed.
			When the session flushes, the changes will be synchronized automatically with the database record. 
			There is <strong>no</strong> need to call <tt>Save()</tt> or <tt>Update()</tt> (details are given
			<a href="#updateneed">below</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
			It is also possible but not recommended to build a transient object from the screen's data and
			call <tt>Save()</tt> or <tt>Update()</tt> to persist the object. This means that one Select is
			avoided, but it works only if all data is present in the screen or request. If the entity is
			changed later, there might be data loss, if the editing screen is not updated!
		</p>
		<p>
			The last operation in CRUD is <strong>D</strong>eletion. There are two possibilities for deletion:
			The entity can be loaded and then <tt>entity.Delete()</tt> is called. The other possibility is calling
			<tt>Entity.Delete(key)</tt>. The latter deletes the entity from the database without loading it into
			memory before. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The entity now enters the deleted state and will be removed from the database when the session flushes.
			If an object has been loaded into memory before, its state will be deleted after calling <tt>Delete()</tt>.
			After the flush the entity is transient again. If it is planned to resave the object again, its 
			primary key property must be either reset to the unsaved value or <tt>Create()</tt> must be explicitly used
			for saving.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="scenario-wizard">
		<title>Wizards and Workflows</title>
		<p>
			Wizards and workflows have one characteristic in common: Entities are edited over a series of screens and
			over multiple sessions or unit of works. The entity is valid before the editing process starts and after
			it has ended, but the data is normally not valid in between.
		</p>
		<note>
			<p>
				Regardless of the actual type of application, the scope of a <strong>unit of work</strong> has
				to be considered carefully. All changes to a database should be part of unit of work. In web
				applications this is obviously a single request. Rich clients (Win32, Windows Forms or WPF
				applications) have better control over the application lifecycle, but they do also profit from
				carefully defined units of work.
			</p>
		</note>
		<p>
			To support this type of operations, the entity in question must be exempted from synchronization
			with the database record before its state is valid again. This also allows to save all changes from
			the workflow in a single operation, keeping the entity consistent.
		</p>
		<p>
			This operation is called <strong>detaching</strong>. After it has been loaded with <tt>Entity.Find()</tt>,
			the object can be detached by calling <tt>scope.Evict(entity)</tt>. The entity will be removed from
			the session cache which is responsible for determining whether an entity is changed and for
			synchronizing entity state.
		</p>
		<p>
			The detached object must be saved internally by the application, for example in the <tt>HttpSession</tt>-cache.
			During the process, parts of the object are changed and it may become temporary invalid by these
			changes. After the process has completed, the object can be reattached to another session by calling
			<tt>entity.Save()</tt> or <tt>entity.Update()</tt>. The changes will be written back to the database
			when the session flushes.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="scenario-concurrent">
		<title>Concurrent Editing</title>
		<p>
			A scenario that only few programmers plan with but all should be prepared to, is concurrent access to
			entities. There are but a few applications that are used by only a single user. Most applications are 
			used by tens, hundreds, thousands or even more users concurrently.
		</p>
		<p>
			The consequence is that the developer has to prepare for an entity being edited from multiple users
			at the same time. These preparations include choosing a locking strategy and a strategy from recovering
			from concurrent change.
		</p>
		<note>
			<p>
				Theoretically, one can choose to use pessimistic or optimistic locking. When locking pessimistically,
				all changes to a record are disallowed when it is edited by another user already. Optimistic locking
				uses version numbers or time stamps to detect changes to a record before saving. That means that the
				object can be edited by multiple users simultaneously, but the users are only allowed to save the
				record when it has not changed in between by other users.
			</p>
			<p>
				ActiveRecord supports pessimistic locking by using <strong>serializable transactions</strong>, although
				it is most often not suitable to the application. Application types that are inherently stateless, like
				web applications should never use pessimistic locking.
			</p>
			<p>
				Optimistic locking can be implemented with special fields in the ActiveRecord classes. See
				<a href="..\advanced\versionts.html">the section on using Version and Timestamp attributes</a> for
				further information. 
			</p>
		</note>
		<p>
			This scenario resembles CRUD, but it is now assumed that an optimistic locking strategy is used and that
			there are multiple users editing an entity simultaneously. In this example, both John and Paul work with
			the same entity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Paul opens the page for editing and walks away from his workplace to fetch coffee. John opens the entity
			meanwhile and edits it. He saves his changes while Paul is talking to a coworker with the coffee in his
			hand. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Now Paul returns. His page still displays the old values before John's changes. Paul edits the entity
			and wants to save it. Now, what should happen. Paul made his changes based on an outdated version of
			the entity. If this is not checked, Johns changes are completely lost, even if Paul edited only data
			that John didn't change.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem in this case is that Paul's object is stale. ActiveRecord can detect the stale state by
			using a version number or a timestamp property within the entity. If for example a version number had
			been used, ActiveRecord would have tried to overwrite only the record with Paul's primary key
			<strong>and</strong> version number. The object would have not been updated and the database would
			have reported a row count of 0. ActiveRecord would have known by this that the object is in a stale
			state and have thrown an exception.
		</p>
		<p>
			ActiveRecord guards against overwriting changes in this case, but it doesn't provide any measures to
			recover from the situation. The client code has to decide itself how the situation must be handled.
			A common strategy is to show the user both the updated and his own version and let him decide which
			information to save.

<section id="savecreateupdate">
	<title>Save, Create and Update</title>
		<section id="updateneed">
		<title>To Save Or Not To Save</title>
		<p>
			Many users believe that <tt>Update()</tt> has to be used to notify ActiveRecord that an entity has changed. 
			This is only partly true. When ActiveRecord is used without a <tt>SessionScope</tt> changes must be saved
			by calling <tt>Save()</tt> or <tt>Update()</tt>. This is no contradiction to the state model above but
			rather a special case. When no scope is used, each session spans only the actual call. Consider the following 
			code:
		</p>
		<pre format="cs"><![CDATA[
Blog blog = Blog.FindFirst();
blog.Name = "new Name";
blog.Save();
]]></pre>
		<p>
			Immediately after the blog object has been created, the session ends. The object is now de-facto detached.
			After the change, <tt>Save()</tt> is called. The object is attached to a new session and immediately flushed
			because the session ends before the call to <tt>Save()</tt> returns.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a <tt>SessionScope</tt> or a <tt>TransactionScope</tt> is used, the situation is different:
		</p>
<pre format="cs"><![CDATA[
using (new SessionScope())
{
	Blog blog = Blog.FindFirst();
	blog.Name = "new Name";
	// blog.Save(); // Unnecessary
}
]]></pre>
		<p>
			Now the object is attached to a session after being created, that won't end until the scope is disposed.
			Because of this, the object is flushed without a call to <tt>Save()</tt> or <tt>Update()</tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>SessionScope</tt>s are sometimes used implicitly, for example in MonoRail web applications with the
			recommended session-per-request-pattern. The session scope is then created transparently at
			the begin of the web request and disposed immediately before the response is sent to the user.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since both type of scopes can be nested, it is recommended to always use scopes. This guarantees that the
			behaviour of for example services that use ActiveRecord is always consistent, no matter whether used from
			a batch job or from a web application. 
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="saveorupdate">
		<title>When to call Save or Create/Update</title>
		<p>
			The <tt>Create()</tt> and <tt>Update()</tt> methods are used when an entity has a natural
			primary key. In this case, ActiveRecord cannot infer whether to <tt>INSERT</tt> or <tt>UPDATE</tt> by
			looking at the primary key of the entity, thus it has to be told explicitly. If surrogate keys are used,
			ActiveRecord knows by looking at the key whether the entity exists at the database. In this case,
			<tt>Save()</tt> is sufficient to persist a transient entity.
