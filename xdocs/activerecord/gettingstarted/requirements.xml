<p>
We assume that you have Castle Project assemblies and the NHibernate assemblies
that comes with it. If you don't, we encourage you to download 
the <a href="../../castle/download.html">MSI installer distribution</a>, 
as it makes the assemblies visible to Visual Studio. 
</p>

<p>
This Getting started assumes that you are using MSSQL Server 2003, 
but any other database supported by NHibernate will do.
</p>

<p>
Proceed with <a href="creatingdb.html">Creating the database and tables</a>.
