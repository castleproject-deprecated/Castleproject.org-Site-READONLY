<p>
We assume that you have Castle Project assemblies and the NHibernate assemblies
that comes with it. If you don't, we encourage you to download 
the <a href="../../castle/download.html">MSI installer distribution</a>, 
as it makes the assemblies visible to Visual Studio. 
</p>

<p>
This Getting started assumes that you are using MSSQL Server 2003, 
but any other database supported by NHibernate will do.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Visual Studio .Net, add references to the
following assemblies:

<ul>
<li>Castle.ActiveRecord.dll</li>
<li>Castle.Core.dll</li>
<li>Castle.DynamicProxy.dll</li>
<li>Iesi.Collections.dll</li>
<li>log4net.dll</li>
<li>NHibernate.dll</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you are using another environment or compiling with NAnt, make
sure assemblies above are referenced from the Castle installation directory.
</p>

<p>
Proceed with <a href="creatingdb.html">Creating the database and tables</a>.
