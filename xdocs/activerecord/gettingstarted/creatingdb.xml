<intro>

<p>
We will use three tables: <tt>User</tt>, <tt>Blog</tt> and <tt>Post</tt>. 
We also use a database called <tt>test</tt>. You can create the 
tables using the schema below or you can let ActiveRecord generate 
the schema for you.

</p>

<p>
As you can see the <tt>User</tt> table has no relation with the others. 
It is going to be used only for controlling access to the application.
Meanwhile the <tt>Blog</tt> and <tt>Post</tt> are related. A blog can have 
many posts, hence the relation is blog is one-to-many and on the post is
many-to-one.
