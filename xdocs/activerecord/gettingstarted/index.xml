<intro>

<p>
<b>Castle ActiveRecord</b> is a powerful tool and allows you do many kinds
of relations easily. Change the classes to match a change in the database
schema is a breeze. It is an important tool for people doing agile development.
</p>

<p>
As <b>Castle ActiveRecord</b> is built on top of 
<a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html">NHibernate</a>, it is also important
that you know how it works and always consult its documentation, especially when 
doing HQL queries.
</p>

<p>
This Getting started will focus on the construction of a Desktop 
application (using Winforms) that manages blogs and its posts. You will learn

<ul>
<li>How to create ActiveRecord types</li>
<li>How to configure and initialize ActiveRecord</li>
<li>How to add methods to your classes to perform searches</li>
</ul>
</p>
