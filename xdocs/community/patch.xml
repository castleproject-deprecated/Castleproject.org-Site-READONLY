<intro>

<p>
A patch is a file that uniffies the differences of a target file. 
It is useful to us as we can see exactly what you changed, think 
about the implications and ultimately approve the patch so your 
changes are committed to the code repository.
</p>

<p>
We strongly encourage that you include test cases for your changes.
If you need any help on how to test something, ask for help
on the development mailing list.

	<title>Creating a patch with TortoiseSVN</title>

	<p>
	After you have finished changing the files you are
	ready to create a patch file. To do so, right
	click the files or the root folder 
	and select TortoiseSVN\Create Patch
	</p>
	
	<note>
	<p>
	If your modification includes new files or new folders
	you must <b>add</b> them before create the patch.
	When you <b>add</b> the files you show mark the files
	for inclusion. To add files or folders with TortoiseSVN, right click
	the folder or the files and select TortoiseSVN\Add.
