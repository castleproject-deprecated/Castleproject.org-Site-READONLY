You can access our forum to ask questions related to 
the our projects.
</p>

<p>
<b>Before you post a question</b>, make sure you follow these
basic rules:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Select the appropriate forum for your question</li>
<li>Use a descriptive and meaningful subject. <b>(i.e. do not use "please help me")</b></li>
<li>Ask specific, narrowed, questions. We will not spend an hour to reply to a question</li>
<li>Posts like "do my work for me" won't be replied</li>
<li>If your problem is an exception, please post the exception type, the message and the inner exceptions</li>
<li>If possible compile the version you are using with debug enabled to have more information like line numbers</li>
<li>It is always valuable to post code that demonstrates your usage or the scenario</li>
<li>When posting code or xml, enclose the content with [code] and [/code] tags</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
And please remember that being nice is the currency of the open source world.
