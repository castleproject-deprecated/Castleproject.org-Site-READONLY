<intro>
<p>
The DynamicProxy project was created to overcome the CLR's proxy (in)capabilities. 
There are proxies in the CLR world, but they can be considered a bit intrusive as 
they force one to extend MarshalByRefObject or ContextBoundObject.
</p>

<p>
You can use DynamicProxy to generate lightweight proxies on the fly for one or more 
interfaces or even concrete classes (but only virtual methods will be intercepted).
