<intro>

<p>
<b>Castle MonoRail</b> greatly simplifies web development. 
This Getting Started is going to show you how common tasks 
are handled and how MonoRail performs most of the repetitive
work on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
Among other things you will learn
<ul>
<li>What is a controller and a view, and their relation</li>
<li>How to use layouts and rescues</li>
<li>How to use the SmartDispatcherController and the DataBinder</li>
<li>How to easily create a CRUD page</li>
<li>How Castle ActiveRecord integrates nicely with MonoRail</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Although it should go without saying, you are not obligated to
use ActiveRecord as your primary data access approach with MonoRail. 
You can use whatever
data access approach you like. That being said if you do use ActiveRecord, there
are some developed integrations that might save you some time. You can develop similar 
integration for your data access approach of choice as well.
