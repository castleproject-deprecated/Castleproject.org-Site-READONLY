<intro>

<p>
<b>Castle MonoRail</b> greatly simplifies web development. 
This Getting Started is going to show you how common tasks 
are handled and how MonoRail performs most of the repetitive
work on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
Amongst other things you will learn
<ul>
<li>What is a controller and a view, and their relation</li>
<li>How to use layouts and rescues</li>
<li>How to use the SmartDispatcherController and the DataBinder</li>
<li>How to easily create a CRUD page</li>
<li>How Castle ActiveRecord integrates nicely with MonoRail</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Although it should go without saying, there are no requirements to
use ActiveRecord with MonoRail. You can use MonoRail with whatever
data access approach you like. However, if you use ActiveRecord, there
are some developed integrations that might save you a few keystrokes.
