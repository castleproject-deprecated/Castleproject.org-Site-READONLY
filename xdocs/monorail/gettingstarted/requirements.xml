<intro>

<p>
We assume that you have Castle Project assemblies on your local machine. 
If you don't, we encourage you to download 
the <a href="../../castle/download.html">MSI installer distribution</a>, 
as it makes the assemblies visible to Visual Studio. 
</p>

<p>
The initial project skeleton will use the 
<a href="../../castle/vsintegration.html">Castle MonoRail project wizard</a>. But you 
can also create the same skeleton manually.
</p>

<p>
This Getting started will use a database 
at some point, and we assume that you are using MSSQL Server 2000, 
but any other database supported by NHibernate will do.
</p>

<p>
Proceed with <a href="creatingproject.html">Creating the project skeleton</a>.
