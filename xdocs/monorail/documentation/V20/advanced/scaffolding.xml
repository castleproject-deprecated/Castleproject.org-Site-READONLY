<intro>

<p>
Scaffolding is a idea borrowed from <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Scaffold">Ruby on Rails</a>.
It refers to the ability to create pages with a simple interface to data in a database with very little effort.

	<title>Scaffolding support on MonoRail</title>
	
<p>
As every project under the Castle Project umbrella does not obligate you to 
embrace it all, scaffolding is implemented with the <tt>IScaffoldingSupport</tt> interface.
</p>

<p>
MonoRail will instantiate the implementation specificed if it discovers a
controller with one or more <tt>ScaffoldingAttribute</tt>:
</p>

<pre format="cs">
[Scaffolding(typeof(Blog))]
public class BlogsController : Controller
{
    public BlogsController()
    {
    }
}</pre>

<p>
The scaffolding implementor should register actions as 
a dynamic action provider.
</p>

<p>
The default implementation of scaffolding support 
relies on Castle ActiveRecord and is discussed in 
the <a href="../integration/arscaffold.html">integrations documentation section</a>.
