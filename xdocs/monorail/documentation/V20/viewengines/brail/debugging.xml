Brail will throw an exception for any compilation errors, which will include the reason for the error as well as the transformed source code that caused the error, you can use that in order to find out what went wrong.

<p>
One thing to be aware of with batch compilation is that if one of your scripts has an error, it will cause the entire batch to fail. 
Each script in the directory will first try the batch option, and when that fails, it will compile itself as a stand-alone assembly. This can be bad for performance if there are a lot of scripts in a directory. However, a second request for such a script would be served from memory, so it's not too bad.

	While it <i>should</i> be possible to debug the views scripts (add <tt>System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break()</tt> instead of a breakpoint), I don't recommend it. There is a quite a bit of compiler magic behind <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org">Boo</a> as it is, and Brail does its fair share as well. It's likely that you won't have a good experience.
