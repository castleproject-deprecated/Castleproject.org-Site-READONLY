<intro>

<p>
The Custom Session extension allow you to plug a custom 
implementation for the session available on <tt>IRailsEngineContext</tt>. 
This can be useful if you have requirements to implement 
on a session that ASP.Net Session strategies can not fulfil.

<p>
In order to use this extension you must provide an 
implementation of <tt>ICustomSessionFactory</tt> which would be 
responsible to create your own session implementation. 
A really naive implementation could map some cookie 
value to an instance of <tt>Hashtable</tt>, for instance.
</p>

<p>
Extensions were introduced to allow the framework to be extended easily
and extensions to be reused.

and also provide the attribute <tt>customsession</tt> to 
inform the type that implements <tt>ICustomSessionFactory</tt> as follows:
