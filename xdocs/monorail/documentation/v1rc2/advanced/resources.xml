<intro>

<p>
Aside from the file system you can have views on the resource assemblies.
This feature was introduced due to a necessity to reuse controllers, filters and
views among projects, for example an user administration module. 
</p>

<p>
To configure the assemblies that have views, use the <tt>additionalSources</tt>
configuration node. See <a href="../manual/configurationref.html">MonoRail Configuration Reference</a>
document.
