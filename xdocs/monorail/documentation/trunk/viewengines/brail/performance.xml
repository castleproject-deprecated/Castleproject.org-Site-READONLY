I've not tested it with any serious load, but it should be good enough for everything you would throw at it. If you want to use Brail for 10 million transactions a day, I would suggest measuring first.

<p>
Batch compilation should reduce compile time and memory size. The code is <i>not</i> interpreted, it's statically compiled (very similar to how ASP.Net does it) and run whenever a request comes in. Currently there is no further reason to complicate the code until someone actually needs it. The second time that a request comes in for a page, it's already compiled and can immediately serve the request.
</p>

<p>
A change in a single file will cause a separate assembly to be loaded, and all future requests will go the the new assembly immediately. Be aware that a large number of changes in an application will cause an assembly leak, since the assemblies cannot be unloaded until the AppDomain is unloaded. This isn't a problem in production scenarios, and on a development machine, the usual IIS application resets should take care of it.

<p>
If you think that reflection kills your performance, make sure to reference your relevant assemblies and use casting to the appropriate types when applicable.

	<b>Multi-threading</b>: Brail <i>should</i> be thread safe. I say "should" because it's hard to be 100% certain of such a thing. I believe that the worst case scenario is a duplicate assembly load, but this will have no affect on the application itself. I would be quite surprised if this ever happens, though.

<p>
<b>Boo Magic:</b> The boo compiler allows you to insert your code in the middle, and do arbitrary transforms on the code. This is what allows a lot of the magic that is going on in Brail. I couldn't have done it without the coolness already embedded in Boo.
