<intro>

<p>
MonoRail can be viewed as another implementation of <tt>IHttpHandler</tt>.
It basically extracts information from the Url and searches for a 
controller in a binary tree. If found, the controller is created
and from that point on, the controller handles the request.
</p>

<p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img relative="images/monorail/mr_flow.png" />
</div>
</p>

<p>
The controller is able to select the action (method)
to invoke, process the arguments (in the case of <tt>SmartDispatcherController</tt>)
and delegate the execution to the action.
</p>

<p>
When the action returns, the controller checks if a view was selected
(and no redirect was issued). If so the ViewEngine is invoked to process
the selected view, which renders the content directly to the client's browser.
</p>

<p>
As MonoRail runs on top of Asp.Net infrastructure (not to be confused with WebForms)
it takes advantage of all features like Session management, Application/Request level
events and security.
