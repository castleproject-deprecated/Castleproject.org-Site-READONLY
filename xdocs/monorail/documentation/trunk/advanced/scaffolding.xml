Scaffolding is a term imported from Ruby on Rails.
 It refers to the ability to create CRUD pages with no effort.

	<title>Scaffolding support on MonoRail</title>
	
<p>
As every project under Castle umbrella does not obligate you to 
embrace it all, we decided to abstract the Scaffolding 
behind an interface: <tt>IScaffoldingSupport</tt>.
</p>

<p>
MonoRail is in charge of instantiate the implementation you provide if, 
and only if, it bump into a controller using one or more <tt>ScaffoldingAttribute</tt>:
</p>

<pre format="cs">
[Scaffolding(typeof(Blog))]
public class BlogsController : Controller
{
    public BlogsController()
    {
    }
}</pre>

<p>
The scaffolding implementor should register actions as 
a dynamic action provider.
</p>

<p>
The default implementation of Scaffolding support 
relies on Castle ActiveRecord and is discussed on 
the Integrations documentation section.
