    <title>Legacy Routing (XML Based)</title>
  </properties>

  <body>

<intro>

<p><strong>This style of Routing has been superseded in favor of <a href="routing.html">our new Routing engine</a>.</strong></p>

<p>
MonoRail supports simple URL rewrites based on regular expressions.
However, to use it for nicer URLs you must allow the ASP.NET ISAPI 
to handle all file extensions, which has a performance penalty.
</p>

<p>
Another approach is to use an ISAPI filter that is able to 
rewrite URLs based on pattern matching. 
<a href="http://www.iismods.com">Mod_Rewrite</a> is one example of
an ISAPI filter which performs URL rewriting.
By using a ISAPI filter to rewrite URLs no wildcard mapping needs to
be configured to direct all requests to the ASP.NET ISAPI.
Even though the ASP.NET ISAPI will process requests for static files this
is not ideal for a production site because of the performance penalty.
</p>

<p>
Other URL rewriting solutions are available by different companies, some of them are free.
<a href="http://www.isapirewrite.com/">ISAPI_Rewrite Lite</a> is one example.

	<title>Using it</title>
	
	<p>
1 - Depending on how you intend to use routing will determine how it needs to
be configured. If you will always be using filenames you only need map the
specific extensions you want to work with (such as .aspx, .rails, .content, .article, etc).
However, if you intend on routing directories (such as http://localhost/myapp/somedir/)
then you will need to map everything (*.*) in IIS to aspnet_isapi.dll which causes IIS to
redirect every request to the ASP.NET ISAPI (be aware of the consequences).
	</p>

	<p>
2 - Create a <tt>routing</tt> element under the <tt>monorail</tt> element in your
web.config as shown below. Routing rules will be evaluated in a top-down order
until a match is found. If there are no matches the request will continue as
normal with the requested URL.
	</p>

<pre format="html">
 &lt;monorail&gt;
  &lt;routing&gt;
   &lt;rule&gt;
    &lt;pattern&gt;(/blog/posts/)(\d+)/(\d+)/(.)*$&lt;/pattern&gt;
    &lt;replace&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ /blog/view.rails?year=$2&amp;month=$3 ]]&gt;&lt;/replace&gt;
   &lt;/rule&gt;
   &lt;rule&gt;
    &lt;pattern&gt;(/news/)(\d+)/(\d+)/(.)*$&lt;/pattern&gt;
    &lt;replace&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ /news/view.rails?year=$2&amp;month=$3 ]]&gt;&lt;/replace&gt;
   &lt;/rule&gt;
  &lt;/routing&gt;
 &lt;/monorail&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
3 - Add the routing module to the <tt>httpModules</tt> element of <tt>system.web</tt> in your web.config.
Ensure that the routing module is listed before the monorail module as shown below.
	</p>

<pre format="html">
<![CDATA[
 <system.web>
  <httpHandlers>
   <add verb="*" path="*.rails"
     type="Castle.MonoRail.Engine.MonoRailHttpHandlerFactory, Castle.MonoRail.Engine" />
  </httpHandlers>

  <httpModules>
   <!-- NOTE: Routing MUST come before the monorail module -->
   <add name="routing" type="Castle.MonoRail.Framework.RoutingModule, Castle.MonoRail.Framework" />
   <add name="monorail" type="Castle.MonoRail.Framework.EngineContextModule, Castle.MonoRail.Framework" />
  </httpModules>
 </system.web>
]]></pre>

	<p>
The regular expressions are compiled, therefore performance should be acceptable.
If no matches are found then the request is processed as it would be without routing.
	</p>

	<p>
This example routing rule defines that a request for the URL <tt>/blog/posts/2000/11/anything</tt>
will be processed as if it was <tt>/blog/view.rails?year=2000&amp;month=11</tt>:
	</p>

<pre format="html">
   &lt;pattern&gt;(/blog/posts/)(\d+)/(\d+)/(.)*$&lt;/pattern&gt;
   &lt;replace&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ /blog/view.rails?year=$2&amp;month=$3 ]]&gt;&lt;/replace&gt;
</pre>

	<title>Root Directory Mapping Work Around</title>

	<p>
If you do not want to setup a wildcard mapping just to get a 
default document for your root directory you can use these steps:
	</p>

	<p>
	<ul>
<li>Create an empty file in your root directory that is mapped to aspnet_isapi.dll
and is a configured as a default document in IIS. For example, create a file named
index.rails or default.aspx depending on your configuration.</li>

<li>Then create a new routing rule in your web.config as shown below.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<pre format="html">
 &lt;monorail&gt;
  &lt;routing&gt;
   &lt;rule&gt;
    &lt;pattern&gt;^(/index.rails)(.)*$&lt;/pattern&gt;
    &lt;replace&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ /Controller/Action.rails?$2 ]]&gt;&lt;/replace&gt;
   &lt;/rule&gt;
  &lt;/routing&gt;
 &lt;/monorail&gt;
</pre>

<note>
	<p>
	This work around is only feasible for root directories because the default
	document file must be created in each directory which is not practical for
	URLs that contain dynamic strings.
	</p>

<section id="anotherapproach">
	<title>Another approach</title>

	<p>
		David Moore has sent an interesting approach he uses:
	</p>

	<p>"I really like mod_rewrite, but as you can see it requires 3rd party
	components also.</p>
	
	<p>
		The easiest thing is to use what you already have at your fingertips with
		IIS, ASP.NET
		and MonoRail itself, and route all requests through ASP.NET.
		Then, you can use the MonoRail URL rewriting features within web.config.
	</p>

	<p>Now performance-wise, you don't want to route requests through the
	ASP.NET/MonoRail stack
	for things such as .css files, image resources etc.
	What I do for this is that I map the URLs for all static resources to
	another
	virtual directory which is purely IIS serving up these files.
	</p>

	<p>I.e. I make the $static variable available in all my NVelocity templates,
	and if I
	insert an image it looks like this: &lt;img src="$static/images/image.gif"/&gt;
	as a
	simple example.</p>

	<p>This currently resolves to http://localhost/static/images/image.gif, with
	/static
	being a virtual directory, and within there all my static content (css,
	javascript,
	images etc).</p>

	<p>This is very scalable in that in a production environment, we can change
	our $static
	to point to http://static.ourdomain.com and have light and fast web
	servers such as
	lighttpd or just a vanilla IIS serving up our static content fast, easing
	the load
	on a dedicated application server.</p>

	<p>So in summary, I evaluated mod_rewrite-style alternatives and went with
	the simple
	solution built into MonoRail, and implemented a good practice of having a
	separate
	URL for static content which is going to make our application more
	scalable in the
	future anyway."</p>
