<p>
It is very common to have a portion of UI content
that is reused amongst pages. When the content is more
than simple static content you can rely on the 
<tt>ViewComponent</tt> infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
A <tt>ViewComponent</tt> is a class that resembles
the controller functionality. It might use views and
send data to the view. It also support inner sections
and parameters.
