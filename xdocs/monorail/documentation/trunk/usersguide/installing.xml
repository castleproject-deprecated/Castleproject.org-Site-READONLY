<intro>

<p>
MonoRail does not require any complex installation. 
However, you must associate the extension you want to 
use with the ASP.Net ISAPI on IIS.
</p>

<p>
If you want to deploy your web site in a shared host
just use an already registered extension then.

	<p>
	On a shared hosting, you may not be able to convince the host to map .rails extentions to the ASP.Net framework, which means that you wouldn't be able to "catch" a request for a rails document and map it to the appropriate controller.
	</p>

	<p>
	A simple solution for this problem is to just switch to .aspx extention (and change the httpHandler configuration, of course). For example:
	</p>

<pre format="html">
<![CDATA[
<httpHandlers>
	<add verb="*" path="*.ashx" 
	   type="Castle.MonoRail.Framework.MonoRailHttpHandlerFactory, Castle.MonoRail.Framework" />
</httpHandlers>]]></pre>
