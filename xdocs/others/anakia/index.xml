<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/docs/anakia.html">Anakia</a> is 
an Ant task used to build most of Apache Software Foundation
documentation for their web site. Documents are written in a clean 
xml format and a Velocity file is used to transform it to html.
</p>

<p>
Castle Anakia is a NAnt task inspired on Anakia. It wasn't a port
instead it was built from the scratch and new features were introduced like the support for site maps,
links revisions and breadcrumbs.
</p>

<p>
It was built based on Castle web site requirements. We can't 
garantee fitness for different purposes.
