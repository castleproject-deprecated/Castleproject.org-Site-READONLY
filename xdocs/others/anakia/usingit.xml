<intro>
<p>
There are a few steps involved in getting Anakia working. First you need to create 
the content documents which are simple xml files. The structure is up to you. Then you create
a transformation file, which uses NVelocity syntax. A project file can be used to define
the project menu and content that is used by all pages. Finally an optional navigation file
can be added to each folder, to define a contextual navigation. 
</p>

<section id="files">
  <title>The files</title>
  
  <p>
The sections below explain the files and their roles. Bear in mind that they are most a convention
than something enforced by the tool. From Anakia point of view, their are just xml content. It's up
to you to make everything work.
  </p>

<section id="contentfiles">
<title>The content files</title>
<p>
Each content file defines a content that ultimately will be transformed to a html page. It's up
to you to define the structure, as long as the transformation file matches that structure when 
transforming the content to html.
</p>

<p>
Castle Anakia site map implementation assumes that you use sections, which can be nested up to three levels. Castle web site uses the structure depicted below: 
</p>

<pre format="html">
<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<document>
<properties>
	<title>Page title</title>

<body>
  <intro>
    <p>Some paragraphs with an introductory explanation</p>
  </intro>
  
  <section id="an optional id">
	<title>The section title</title>
    <p>Section content paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Section content paragraph 2</p>
	
	<section>
	  <title>A sub section</title>
      <p>Another paragraph</p>
	</section>
  </section>

]]>
</pre>

</section>

<section id="projectfile">
<title>The index file</title>
<p>
The <tt>index.xml</tt> file is a content file that is treated differently by Castle Anakia when generating breadcrumbs and sitemaps. The folder title for example is get from the <tt>index.xml</tt> title property.
</p>
</section>

<section id="projectfile">
<title>The project file</title>
<p>
The <tt>project.xml</tt> file should contain information that is shared by all content pages. For example
common links, or a default menu structure.
</p>
</section>

<section id="navfile">
<title>The navigation file</title>
<p>
The <tt>navigation.xml</tt> file can appear on each folder and should contain contextual information
for the folder and subfolders. For example, it can override the menu, or enhance the 
navigation.
</p>
</section>

<section id="navfile">
<title>The transformation file</title>
<p>
The transformation file is a NVelocity template that needs to transverse the xml document 
and generate the final html.
