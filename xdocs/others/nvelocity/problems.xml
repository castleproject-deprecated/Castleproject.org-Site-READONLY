There are things that we could not fix yet, and things we know are buggy.
The section below documents that before people run into the same problems we did.

	<title>Macro support</title>
	
	<p>
	Macros can be used, but are very limited and buggy. For instance
	if used recursively and with parameters, the stack is not pop'ed 
	correctly and the local variables end up assuming the values of deepest
	calls.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There are hacks to overcome the problem, but it is better to avoid them.
