<intro>
<p>
Aspect# is an AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) framework for the CLI (.Net and Mono).<br/> It relies on <a href="#">DynamicProxy</a> and offers a built-in language to declare and configure aspects, and is compliant with AopAlliance.
<br/>
It became part of the Castle Project in June 2005.

<p>Aspect# promotes:
	<ul>
		<li>Separation of Concerns(SoC)</li>
		<li>Code reuse</li>
		<li>Decomposition.</li>
	</ul>
	
	And it offers, plus the basic AoP capabilities, Mixins and a Ruby like configuration language 
	making the framework flexible and easy to use.
