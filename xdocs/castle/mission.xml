<intro>

<p>
Castle Project has a well defined mission, that can be easily stated as
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<strong>
To provide a simple set of tools to speed up the development of 
common enterprise and web applications while promoting good architecture. 
</strong>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
We also need to state what we do not want to provide and what 
we do not want to be labeled:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Castle is not a set of classes that must be specialized to create your 
	application. <i>Castle should not force you to adhere to a specific architecture</i>.</li>

    <li>Castle should not be all-or-nothing. The developer can use the tools he 
	wants to use, and at the same time, use different approaches 
	in different areas of his application in a peaceful manner. </li>

    <li>Castle should not be configuration-driven, and more important, 
	should not be XML-driven. Configuration should be used only to 
	express external settings, or as a hint to help the application to 
	assemble itself. We shall look forward to delivering self-assemblying capabilities. </li>
</ul>
