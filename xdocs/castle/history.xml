A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Project">brief history</a> of the Castle Project is also available at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>

<p>
Castle was born from the Apache Avalon project, in mid 2003, as 
an attempt to build a very simple inversion of 
control container. The overall design was the result of 
more than a year in contact with masters of the Avalon 
land like Carsten Ziegeler, Leo Sutic, Leo Simons and Berin Loritsch to name a few.
</p>

<p>
After several discussions about what a 
useful container must solve, Castle's first draft 
was created. Several changes (and rewrites) have taken place before 
reaching its current form.
</p>

<p>
However, Castle had a more ambitious agenda. Tools like DynamicProxy 
and the Management Extensions were used by several projects and a 
proper home to support those users and build a community around them was necessary. 
Along the same lines, these tools had nothing in common with Avalon's 
mission, so we had to find a more suitable home for them.
</p>

<p>
Since then a new mission came, and new projects flourished. 
The Castle Project team is as concerned with the quality of the projects as it is 
concerned with the health of its community.
