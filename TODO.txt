Some things that would be nice to have done. 

==General Stuff==

* An RSS feed for the news. 
* A dedicated news page to archive the news to.
* Intergrate the Co-op search widget into the front page (or overall template?). 
* Add stuff to do to TODO.txt

==Missing Documentation==

* FormHelper is missing NumberField docs..
