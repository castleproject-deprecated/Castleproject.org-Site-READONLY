Some things that would be nice to have done. 

==General Stuff==

* An RSS feed for the news. 
* A dedicated news page to archive the news to.
* Intergrate the Co-op search widget into the front page (or overall template?). 
* Add stuff to do to TODO.txt

==Missing Documentation==

* FormHelper is missing NumberField docs..
	http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/helpers/form/index.html
	http://www.castleproject.org/MonoRail/documentation/trunk/helpers/form/Generated_FormHelper.html
* FormHelper API 
	- show TextFieldFormat as obsolete and detail the method/attribute used to replace it

==Incorrect Documentation==

* /activerecord/documentation/trunk/manual/validators.html - describes the old AR validation stuff which has been removed and replaced with Castle.Components.Validator. Need to check through the docs and removed references to this stuff.
